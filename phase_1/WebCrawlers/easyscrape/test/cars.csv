Ford Escape,Ford,"$24,495",20/27,7.1,245,116,"With athletic looks and a quiet, stylish interior, the Escape distinguishes itself in a crowd of small crossovers. The base engine is a 168-hp four-cylinder, but we recommend the 179-hp turbo four or the 245-hp turbo four. All have front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional on turbos. Handling is precise and predictable, but the steering feels rubbery. Ford’s Sync 3 is controlled by an 8.0-inch touchscreen with voice recognition. A properly equipped Escape can tow 3500 pounds.                    ,"
Jeep Grand Cherokee,Jeep,"$31,290",18/25,7.1,295,118,"Thanks to its famous off-road grit, the Grand Cherokee’s expertise doesn’t begin and end in the concrete jungle like many of its rivals. A 295-hp 3.6-liter V-6, eight-speed automatic, and rear-drive are standard; a 240-hp turbo-diesel V-6 and 360-hp 5.7-liter V-8 are optional, as are three four-wheel drive setups, each with varying capabilities. A tidy cabin with touchscreen infotainment and optional Wi-Fi make the Grand Cherokee a pleasant place to be whether fording rivers or running errands.                    ,"
Honda Accord,Honda,"$23,190",21/32,5.6,278,127,"The Accord delivers driving fun in a practical package, which helps make it a 10Best winner for 2016. A 185-hp 2.4-liter four and a six-speed manual are standard in the coupe and sedan; Sport models make 189 hp. A CVT is optional, as is a 278-hp 3.5-liter V-6 with a six-speed automatic; the coupe offers a six-speed manual. The hybrid sedan got 45 mpg in our testing. EX models and above feature Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but some may find the button-less infotainment system annoying to use.                    ,"

Lamborghini Aventador,Lamborghini,"$402,995",11/18,2.7,740,217,"Brutally powerful and obscenely flamboyant, the Aventador is unburdened by reality. Crazy expensive and crazy fast, it’s capable of amazing performance without feeling like it’s going to snap-spin into a ditch, which is refreshing in a supercar. Available as a coupe (or roadster), it has a 6.5-liter 691-hp V-12, a 7-speed automated manual transmission and all-wheel drive. For the ultimate, the Superveloce has 740 hp and a claimed top speed of 217 mph. In our testing, it did 0-60 in 2.7 seconds.                    ,"
Jeep Wrangler,Jeep,"$24,990",17/21,7.5,285,109,"In a world of soft-road-only car-based crossovers, the Wrangler is a tough-as-nails off-road expert. Four-wheel drive is standard, as are a 285-hp 3.6-liter V-6 and a six-speed manual; a five-speed automatic is optional. Two- and four-door “Unlimited” models are offered, both with a choice of soft or hard convertible tops. The Rubicon gets front and rear locking differentials, a 4.0:1 low-gear ratio, and a disconnecting front anti-roll bar for wheel articulation and rock-crawling prowess.                    ,"
Lamborghini Huracan,Lamborghini,"$203,295",14/20,2.5,602,N/A,"Nothing on Earth can prepare you for the eyeball-melting performance of Lamborghini’s “entry-level” supercar, the Huracán. The angular design is severe yet elegant; the stealth fighter–like cockpit is as luxurious as it is intense. Nestled behind the cockpit is a 5.2-liter V-10 with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic (sorry, no manual transmission is offered); with rear-wheel drive, it makes 571 hp and with all-wheel drive it produces 602. A convertible version (Spyder) is also available.                    ,"
Ford F-150,Ford,"$27,735",14/19,6.3,385,106,"The legendary F-150—now with an aluminum bed and body—remains the hard-working pickup it’s always been. The base 3.5-liter V-6 makes 253 lb-ft; a 2.7-liter turbo V-6 (375 lb-ft) and 5.0-liter V-8 (387 lb-ft) are available, too, but the optional 3.5-liter turbo V-6 (420 lb-ft) is best for towing, boasting a maximum capacity of 12,200 pounds. All engines have a six-speed automatic. Regular cab, SuperCab and SuperCrew bodies as well as 5.5-, 6.5-, or 8-ft beds make the F-150 fit many needs.                    ,"

McLaren 570S / 570GT,McLaren,"$187,300",16/23,2.9,562,204,"There are two members of the 570 family: the 570S and the 570GT; both are set to kick sand in the face of lesser sports cars. The S is sportier, while the GT is set up for long-distance-driving comfort. Both models have a twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-8 making 562 hp and 443 lb-ft, mounted behind the cabin; a carbon-fiber tub reduces weight and adds strength. A sequential seven-speed gearbox drives the rear wheels. The S is faster to 62 mph by 0.2 second; both models have a top speed of 204 mph.                    ,"
Infiniti QX60,Infiniti,"$43,595",,,,,"Crossover capability doesn’t come at the cost of luxury or comfort in the stylish QX60. A creamy ride, a nicely appointed interior, and an easy-access third row highlight this seven-seater. The engine is a 295-hp 3.5-liter V-6 driving the front wheels; all-wheel drive is optional. The EPA rates the hybrid model at 27 mpg highway. An 8.0-inch touchscreen is standard; rear-seat entertainment and onboard Wi-Fi are options. Also available are adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking.                    ,"
Subaru WRX STI,Subaru,"$36,015",17/23,4.7,305,159,"Don’t let the giant trunk wing fool you: The STI is not about to go airborne before your very eyes. With 305 hp from its 2.5-liter turbo four-cylinder, it’s just not the performance threat that it used to be. A six-speed manual, limited-slip differentials, and torque vectoring help keep the STI glued to the road. Its steering is laser-quick and its brakes grip like crazy. The result makes it entertaining to drive, but it comes at the price of a punishing ride—and a punishing price.                    ,"
Infiniti QX80,Infiniti,"$64,845",13/19,6.2,400,133,"As big as a luxury yacht and just as opulent inside, the QX80 is Infiniti’s answer to the Cadillac Escalade. It’s built on a full-size truck frame and powered by a 400-hp 5.6-liter V-8 with a seven-speed automatic; rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. The QX80 can accelerate briskly and tow up to 8500 lb, with standard seating for seven and eight optionally. In terms of quiet and comfort, it matches its competitors; when it comes to price, it is often cheaper.                    ,"
Infiniti QX70,Infiniti,"$46,845",,,,,"Flaunting a rakish, athletic stance and boisterous exhaust note, the QX70 is a snazzy standout. A somewhat coarse but brawny 325-hp 3.7-liter V-6 is mated to a seven-speed automatic; choose either rear- or all-wheel drive. The QX70 feels at home hustling around corners but the steering is regrettably numb. Passengers are treated to an attractive and hospitable cabin chock full of tech toys. The ride is too firm to be considered luxurious, but that may be appealing to more spirited drivers.                    ,"
Honda Ridgeline,Honda,"$30,375",18/25,6.6,280,112,"The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated. Its 3.5-liter V-6 makes 282 hp and 262 lb-ft, with front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic; the all-wheel-drive version has a towing capacity of 5000 pounds. In our highway-fuel-economy test, we saw 28 mpg with the AWD model. The 64-inch bed has a two-way tailgate; it not only has cargo space, but also the makings of a great tailgate party with its available bed-mounted speakers.                    ,"
Honda Odyssey,Honda,"$30,450",19/28,7.7,248,120,"The Odyssey has charmed our staff for years with its unrivaled road manners, smooth powertrain, and accommodating interior. With room for up to eight passengers to sit comfortably, the Odyssey is also fuel-efficient, thanks to the cylinder-deactivation feature on its 248-hp 3.5-liter V-6. Perhaps most exciting is the built-in vacuum in the cargo area. Featured on certain models, it’s so obvious in its usefulness you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. Cheerios everywhere, beware!                    ,"
Honda Pilot,Honda,"$31,245",19/26,6.1,280,114,"If a stylish, useful, and trouble-free ride is what you’re after, well—ladies and gentlemen, this is your Pilot speaking. The 280-hp 3.5-liter V-6 powers the front or all four wheels through a six-speed automatic; top-level Touring and Elite trims get a nine-speed. The all-wheel-drive system offers torque vectoring for better handling and modes for snow, sand, and mud. The Pilot’s three rows provide plenty of room for all and a host of active-safety tech is available to keep everyone safe.                    ,"
Honda Fit,Honda,"$16,825",32/38,8.5,130,119,"A flexible interior, an efficient powertrain, and agreeable pricing make the Fit an easy recommendation. Its firm ride makes it fun to drive, while light steering makes it great for in-town driving—icing on the cake. The handy multiconfigurable interior offers more cargo room than the Fit’s size implies, too. The 130-hp 1.5-liter engine drives the front wheels through a six-speed manual or a CVT. Uplevel EX and EX-L models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system; navigation is optional.                    ,"
Honda Clarity,Honda,"$60,000",,,,,"Powered by hydrogen and emitting only water as its exhaust, the Clarity brings you the future today. Its spacious interior seats five; the estimated driving range is more than 300 miles. Expect a price of around $60,000 and a monthly lease payment of less than $500. (That’s cheaper than a base Tesla Model S.) Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will be included, along with the Honda Sensing suite of safety/driver-assistance tech. The Clarity will be sold in California only, starting in late 2016."
Honda CR-Z,Honda,"$21,130",,,,,"The CR-Z is an ambitious attempt at making a sporty hybrid, but its performance doesn’t match its adventurous styling. The good news is that it’s the only hybrid sold with a manual—a six-speed—but the bad news is that the combined output is a mere 130 hp. A 1.5-liter four-cylinder pairs with an electric motor; the EPA rates it for 36-mpg city/39-mpg highway with the optional CVT; the manual gets 31/38. Standard features include Bluetooth capability, automatic climate control, and cruise.                    ,"
Honda HR-V,Honda,"$20,265",27/32,9.3,141,117,"The HR-V mixes angles and curves in an attractive design that lends it a sporty look while hiding its budget-friendly roots. A 141-hp 1.8-liter four comes with either a six-speed manual or CVT and front- or all-wheel drive. Many safety features are available, and the flat-folding second-row provides cargo-hauling bragging rights. Load it up with extras like lane-departure warning, a seven-inch touch-screen display, and a vehicle telematics system and the HR-V becomes a high-tech haven.                    ,"
GMC Sierra 3500HD,GMC,"$36,185",,,,,"The Sierra 3500 HD is the ultimate luxury workhorse, with its high-line interior and lofty towing/hauling numbers—call it a Taj Mahauler. Its maximum payload is 7153 lb and its trailer-towing capacity is 23,200 lb, when properly equipped. There are three cab styles, two bed lengths, and three engines: a 360-hp 6.0-liter V-8 is standard; options include a 301-hp 6.0-liter gas/CNG V-8 and our choice, the 397-hp 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel with 765 lb-ft and the Allison transmission.                    ,"
Lotus Evora 400,Lotus,"$93,785",,,,,"With its lightweight chassis of bonded aluminum, supple suspension, and mid-engine layout, there’s nothing ordinary about the Evora 400. A supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 cranks out 400 hp; a six-speed manual is standard and a paddle-shifted six-speed automatic is optional. We estimate a 0-to-60 time of 4.3 seconds and a top speed of 172 mph. Handling is lively, steering is light yet responsive, and the brakes excellent; acceleration, however, doesn’t feel as strong as we would expect 400 hp to be.                    ,"
GMC Yukon / Yukon XL,GMC,"$49,725",14/21,5.5,420,112,"As capable as they are handsome, the Yukon and the stretched Yukon XL are multitasking machines. They offer seating for up to eight, a maximum tow rating of 8100 pounds, and optional four-wheel drive. A 355-hp 5.3-liter V-8 and six-speed automatic powers SLE and SLT trims; the chrome-laden, leather-lined Denali offers near-Escalade levels of luxury and gets a 420-hp 6.2-liter V-8 and an eight-speed automatic. An 8.0-inch infotainment system, 4G LTE connectivity, and onboard Wi-Fi are standard.                    ,"
Genesis G90,Genesis,"$69,050",,,,,"With elegant styling and a first-class cabin, the G90 is the Genesis brand’s first attempt at a luxury sedan. Few options are offered; instead, nearly every conceivable feature is standard. Highlights include a 12.3-inch touchscreen for infotainment, adaptive dampers, a head-up display, automated emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Two engines are offered—a 365-hp 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 and a 420-hp 5.0-liter V-8—both with an eight-speed automatic and rear- or all-wheel drive.                    ,"
Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio,Alfa Romeo,"$70,000",,,,,"Seductive looks, a snarling exhaust note, and sharp handling are essential to any Italian sports car, and the racy Giulia Quadrifoglio has all three in spades. A Ferrari-derived 505-hp 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 drives the rear wheels through a six-speed manual; an eight-speed automatic is optional. Four selectable drive modes adjust suspension damping and throttle response; in Race mode, stability control is fully disabled, and the Quadrifoglio is all too happy to swing its tail out for a drift.                    ,"
Fiat 500X,Fiat,"$20,990",25/34,7.8,160,N/A,"Grown up but still cheeky, the 500X complements its minuscule sibling, the Fiat 500, by offering more space and all-weather capability while retaining its classic Italian style. A 160-hp 1.4-liter turbo four drives the front wheels through a six-speed manual; a 180-hp 2.4-liter four and nine-speed automatic power the front or all four wheels. A drive-mode system provides three settings for different driving conditions and the cabin of the 500X is packed with safety features and technology.                    ,"
Lincoln Navigator / Navigator L,Lincoln,"$64,710",15/19,6.5,380,101,"Stepping aboard the Navigator feels like climbing the steps to a private jet, and its commanding view of the road maintains the high-altitude ambiance. A 380-hp 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6, six-speed automatic, and either rear- or four-wheel drive provide up to 9000 pounds of towing capacity. Both standard and long-wheelbase bodies can seat eight, and the third row is even suitable for adults. An eight-inch touchscreen with navigation is standard. A new Navigator should debut sometime in 2017.                    ,"
Ford Transit Connect,Ford,"$24,005",20/28,10.0,169,109,"Focused on utility and economy, this van is available in two wheelbases with seats for up to seven in three rows. There’s more than 100 cubic feet of cargo room; when properly equipped it has a payload of 1620 pounds and can tow 2000 pounds. The base engine is a 169-hp 2.5-liter four; a 178-hp 1.6-liter turbo four is optional. Front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic are standard. With minimal extra power and minimal added fuel economy, we feel the 1.6-liter is not worth the extra cost.                    ,"
Alfa Romeo 4C,Alfa Romeo,"$67,495",24/34,4.2,237,155,"This is a sexy, mid-engined Italian exotic carved down to affordable scale, and it's available as a coupe or with a targa top. Powered by a 237-hp turbo four and weighing less than 2500 pounds, its zippy power-to-weight ratio matches its zippy steering ratio; sadly, only a six-speed automatic is available. The 4C practically anticipates road challenges, but the seats are tight, there's almost no luggage room, and it's so low it's tough to get out of—none of which matters once behind the wheel.                    ,"
Alfa Romeo Giulia,Alfa Romeo,,,,,,"An emotional, hot-blooded Italian car like the Giulia is sure to stand out in the usual entry-luxury crowd. A 276-hp 2.0-liter turbo four with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive is optional. Leather seats, a dual exhaust, and a sporty flat-bottomed steering wheel with integrated push-button start also come standard. A 6.5-inch or optional 8.8-inch touchscreen provide connectivity; high-tech features like adaptive cruise control are also available.                    ,"
Acura MDX,Acura,"$44,890",19/26,5.9,290,113,"The MDX lists spirited handling as one of its key attributes; we think it offers some of the most fun you can have with a vehicle that has three rows of seats. All models come with a 290-hp V-6, a nine-speed automatic and front-wheel drive, but we recommend the all-wheel-drive version (known as Super Handling All-Wheel Drive). The MDX is quick and quiet; braking and handling are above average. Our main disappointment is the bland exterior styling. An updated MDX goes on sale this summer.                    ,"
Acura ILX,Acura,"$28,930",25/36,6.6,201,133,"Although the ILX is basically a Honda Civic, it is a really nice Civic, featuring an interior with upgraded materials. The sole powertrain is a 201-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder with front-wheel drive. The transmission is a dual-clutch eight-speed automatic; a manual is not available. The automatic is smooth and gives the ILX more of a calm and adult demeanor, which is a welcome change from the previous generation’s high-strung character. The ILX offers value for the money versus the competition.                    ,"
Acura RLX,Acura,"$55,390",20/31,5.8,310,133,"As the flagship of the Acura line, the RLX mixes tons of tech with your choice of a gas or a hybrid powertrain. While the gas version makes 310 hp, the hybrid is more compelling. It employs a gas-powered V-6 driving the front wheels via a seven-speed transmission and electric motor; a separate pair of motors controls the rear wheels. This results in 377 combined horsepower and tenacious grip. Both models deliver swift performance and sporty handling; downsides are bland styling and high prices.                    ,"
Acura RDX,Acura,"$36,510",19/28,6.2,279,135,"The RDX is the luxury crossover for those who value comfort, safety, and technology over gratifying driving dynamics. The 3.5-liter V-6 makes 279 hp; front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Both powertrains feature a six-speed automatic with paddle shifters. Fuel efficiency is decent and the ride is tuned for relaxed cruising. Available active safety features such as forward-collision warning and adaptive cruise control help keep the RDX on the road.                    ,"
Acura NSX,Acura,"$156,940",21/22,3.1,73,191,"If you’ve been dreaming of the next NSX, it’s time to wake up: It’s here in the form of a highly technical and utterly thrilling supercar. With weight-saving construction, a hybrid powertrain that has three electric motors and a mid-mounted twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 making a combined output of 573 hp, the NSX offers pulse-pounding performance paired with everyday usability. A nine-speed dual-clutch automatic and all-wheel drive are standard.                    ,"
Acura TLX,Acura,"$32,840",21/31,5.8,290,129,"Acura likes to tout high-tech systems as the main selling points of its models, and the TLX is no exception; it offers four-wheel steering and torque-vectoring all-wheel drive to enhance its agility. The base powertrain is a 206-hp 2.4-liter four with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic or a 290-hp 3.5-liter V-6 with a nine-speed automatic. The TLX has LED exterior lights and electronic driving assistants including AcuraLink, road-departure mitigation, and collision-mitigation braking.                    ,"
Fiat 500L,Fiat,"$21,990",22/30,8.0,160,126,"The 500L features styling that’s adorable to many but a bit too squee-worthy to others. Bigger overall than the regular 500, it has up to 68 cubic feet of storage space, but the interior is poorly assembled and full of cheap materials. A six-speed manual is standard; the optional six-speed automatic is slow to shift and saps driving fun. Both transmissions mate to a 160-hp turbo four. The 500L’s powertrain is challenged by highway merging, but its quick steering puts it at home on city streets.                    ,"
,,,,,,,
Fiat 500,Fiat,"$15,990",28/34,8.1,135,127,"Retro styling and a cheerful character make the 500 a fashionable choice among city cars. Available as either a hatchback or a convertible, the 500 gets a 101-hp 1.4-liter four, which pairs to a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Sporty Turbo models get a boost in output to 135 hp, but real speed demons will still be left wanting. An intuitive five-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard; navigation and an array of appearance items are optional.                    ,"
Fiat 500E,Fiat,"$32,795",122/108,8.4,147,88,"With its tiny size, zippy handling, and an EPA range of 87 miles, the 500E is a fine city car—as long as you don’t need to go anywhere else. The interior is cramped, with an awkward driving position and a rear seat that is best reserved for short people and short distances. On the upside, it is a bit quicker, smoother, and quieter than the gas-powered 500.                    ,"
Fiat 500 / 500C Abarth,Fiat,"$20,990",24/32,6.9,157,N/A,"The tiny 500 goes from pipsqueak to bad-ass as the hot-rod Abarth, the heart of which is a raucous 160-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. A five-speed manual is standard, while a six-speed automatic is optional. The exhaust note is addictive, and thanks to a slammed suspension, the Abarth’s handling is as feisty as its styling. There is a coupe or sliding-canvas soft top, though in open-air form, it can get a little pricey. Still, the Abarth is a special car with a ton of charisma.                    ,"

Spyker C8,Spyker,,,,,,"You’ll probably never see one on the road, yet the C8 Preliator still fires the imaginations of hopeful enthusiasts everywhere. The exterior delights with details like rear taillights inspired by jet nozzles, side-mounted ailerons, and a gold-coated canopy. The interior continues the aero theme, with switches and dials seemingly lifted from a vintage aircraft. With a 525-hp V-8 mounted behind you, you’ll feel ready for takeoff every time you hit the gas. Sadly, that will only be in your dreams"
Fiat 124 Spider,Fiat,"$25,990",26/35,6.3,160,136,"Borrowing heavily from the looks of the Pininfarina-designed original, circa 1966, the 124 Spider is a stylish, if not exactly Italian, two-seat droptop. Its rival—Mazda’s MX-5 Miata—is also its main benefactor, donating its chassis, assembly line, and parts bin. But the 124 Spider does have a unique suspension and powertrain: a 160-hp 1.4-liter turbo four with either a six-speed manual or auto. The racy Abarth gets a sport-tuned exhaust, a limited-slip differential, and a boost to 164 hp.                    ,"

It’s not the 526 hp, the 429 lb-ft of torque, or the 4.3-second zero-to-60-mph run that has us drooling; it’s that Ford has finally built a muscle car that can hold its own through corners.

Under the hood there’s a 5.0-liter V-8 rated at 467 hp mated to an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters.

Some may scoff at a V-6 in a rig of this size, but its 9200-lb towing capacity (when properly equipped) should silence naysayers.

An 8.0-liter sixteen-cylinder engine utilizes four turbos to make 1500 hp and 1180 lb-ft of torque for what will surely be epic acceleration; Bugatti claims a top speed of 261 mph. A seven-speed automatic routes that power through all four wheels. If you have to ask, you can’t afford it—expect a price of around $2.6 million when it goes on sale this fall.                    ,"
Hyundai Azera,Hyundai,"$34,995",20/28,6.2,293,N/A,"From its quiet cabin and refined powertrain to its handsome yet mild styling, the Azera offers plenty to appreciate. Touchscreen navigation is standard, with Blue Link, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. Top-spec Limited models get a tech upgrade with adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, and automatic high-beam assist. The 293-hp 3.3-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic provide enough grunt to haul the front-wheel-drive Azera around. During our testing, it returned 23 mpg on average.                    ,"
Hyundai Elantra,Hyundai,"$17,985",32/40,7.8,128,120,"The handsome Elantra has balanced proportions and angular sheetmetal, and it also offers great value. A 147-hp four-cylinder mates to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. The frugal Eco, with its seven-speed automatic, averaged 38 mpg in our most recent test. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, as are heated rear seats. Optional safety tech includes automatic emergency braking and lane-keep assist. Vague steering spoils what is otherwise a competent, well-equipped car.                    ,"
BMW X6 M,BMW,"$103,195",14/19,3.7,567,160,"A moving contradiction—albeit a very fast-moving one—the X6 M delivers a modicum of functionality with immense performance. Power comes from a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 producing 567 hp, delivered to BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Practicality is a relative term here, but the performance-tuned suspension assures that the X6 M goes fast in more than just a straight line. The X6 M cloaks its heft in the corners well, making it one amusing ute.                    ,"
BMW X6,BMW,"$62,395",18/27,5.7,300,127,"Unrestrained styling, raucous power, and surprising agility define the X6—although its fastback design limits rear-seat room and cargo space.

An audacious 445-hp 4.4-liter turbo V-8 is optional and comes only with all-wheel drive.

Hyundai Accent,Hyundai,"$15,830",27/38,8.6,137,120,"No need for excuses here: the Accent, with its distinctive design and fuel-sipping engine, is a fine choice for an economical car. Available as a four-door sedan or a five-door hatchback, the interior feels more upscale than the competition’s. Its 137-hp 1.6-liter four-cylinder pairs with either a perky six-speed manual or a sluggish six-speed automatic. The manual rates at 38 mpg highway; the automatic gets 37 mpg.

Its 357-hp hybrid powertrain drives all four wheels; in our hands, the i8 hit 60 mph in 4.0 seconds and saw 38 MPGe on our 200-mile test run. The poised chassis and sharp steering are good fun, but eco-friendly tires and regenerative braking hinder performance. Familiar controls nestle in a plush cabin; the i8’s eye-catching styling is straight out of a sci-fi flick.                    ,"

It handles well due to a low center of gravity; in our testing, it went from 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds. The EPA estimates a battery-only range of 81 miles; it charges in 3 hours on a 220-volt outlet. An optional gas engine extends the total range to 150 miles, quelling dead-battery anxiety.

The former is offered with a six-speed stick or seven-speed dual-clutch auto, while the sDrive35is is offered only with the automatic.

Fireball-quick, in our testing it hit 60 mph in 3.8 seconds. As a product of BMW’s M division, its brakes are amazing and it handles road divots with an initial whack and absolute confidence.

BMW X4,BMW,"$46,545",19/27,5.2,300,144,"Basically a hatchback version of the X3, the X4 is a four-door “coupe,” with a low roof and a more intimate cabin—especially in the back seat. Engine choices are a 240-hp turbo four, a 300-hp turbo six, and for the Xtra-est of Xs, there is the M40i with 355 hp, launch control, bigger front brake discs, 19-inch wheels, and a sport-tuned suspension.

BMW X3,BMW,"$40,245",19/26,5.3,300,127,"The X3 combines the utility of a crossover with the sophistication and driving fun of one of our favorite sedans: the legendary 3-series. There are three turbocharged engines—a 240-hp 2.0-liter four; a 300-hp, 3.0-liter six; and a 180-hp, 2.0-liter diesel four, which offers improved economy but less refinement. An eight-speed automatic is standard; all but the base rear-drive X3 have xDrive. The options list is long, but in our opinion, the Dynamic Handling package is one you must consider.                    ,"
BMW X1,BMW,"$34,095",22/32,6.4,228,129,"Despite its SUV-like body shape, the X1 still offers up some distinctly BMW-like driving fun. Quick, responsive steering and a taut suspension make tossing it through back-country corners a joy.

BMW M6 Gran Coupe,BMW,"$118,495",14/20,3.7,552,160,"We think the “M” in M6 stands for more; here, BMW’s four-door “coupe” comes in a performance version with a sport-tuned chassis and a 560-hp twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. Torque peaks at 500 lb-ft; you have your choice of either a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or—for the true enthusiast—a six-speed manual. The manual matches revs on downshifts for added fun. While the sheetmetal is gorgeous and the interior luxurious, the back seat is too cramped for adults to ride comfortably, if at all.                    ,"
BMW M6,BMW,"$114,695",14/20,4.0,560,155,"Blending a tasteful yet aggressive design with extraordinary performance, the M6 is a sexy beast indeed.

Its 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six pumps out 365 hp and drives the rear wheels through a six-speed manual. An optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic blasts the M2 to 60 in just 4.0 seconds. The poised chassis delivers heroic handling and although the steering is a bit vague at times, this is easily forgiven; sticky Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires and beefy brakes help inspire confidence.                    ,"
BMW 6-series Gran Coupe,BMW,"$80,495",,,,,"With its sweeping roofline and muscular stance, the Gran Coupe disguises a pair of rear doors while retaining the sporty façade of the two-door on which it is based.

A balanced chassis and well-weighted steering make the car a driver’s delight.

Sadly, a manual transmission is not available; rear-drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional.

An updated 205-hp version of the 2.0-liter flat-four pairs to a six-speed manual, hardly answering complaints that the rear-drive sports car lacks punch. Output drops to 200 hp with the six-speed automatic. Still, the BRZ is impeccably balanced and satisfying, not to mention slide-happy.

Active noise cancellation and an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard; a 360-degree camera, adaptive cruise, and automated emergency braking are optional.                    ,"
Buick Encore,Buick,"$23,915",26/32,9.2,153,121,"Small is in, and Buick—a big-car expert—wants everyone to know it can do small just as well. The Encore is a pocket-sized Enclave and features some of the big Buick SUV’s traits. Its stylish cabin is feature rich, quiet, and comfortable for four. The base engine is a 138-hp 1.4-liter turbo four, which delivers on fuel economy but struggles under heavy loads. The Sport boost output to 153 hp for a bit more zip. Handling is fairly agile and the ride is silky smooth, but steering lacks feel.                    ,"
Buick Enclave,Buick,"$39,990",16/22,7.9,288,108,"With luxurious appointments and features, the Enclave is Buick’s upscale family hauler with refinement that rivals more expensive vehicles. Power is delivered by a 281-hp 3.6-liter V-6, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive. The Enclave is a quiet, refined crossover with a long list of optional equipment. Some of those features hike the price of the car quickly, though, and many of those options are only marginally useful.                    ,"
Buick Cascada,Buick,"$33,990",20/27,8.3,200,120,"Buick knows that sometimes it’s more fun to drop your top—hence the Cascada. A 1.6-liter turbo four makes 200 hp; front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic are standard. Despite its sleek looks, the Cascada weighs almost 2 tons, which hinders performance. In our test, it took 8.3 seconds to hit 60 mph—much slower than its competition. More important is that the soft top can drop in 17 seconds and at speeds of up to 31 mph.

Step up to the SL550, and behold the 449-hp, 4.7-liter twin-turbo V-8; it, too, has the nine-speed auto.

Toyota isn’t revealing powertrain info, so we are guessing it will have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, a CVT and front-drive; all-wheel drive will be optional.                    ,"

The 2.0-liter flat-four makes 205 hp when paired to the smooth-shifting six-speed manual. With the optional six-speed automatic, however, power drops to 200 hp—but we doubt you’ll be able to tell. Rear-wheel drive and a balanced chassis provide endless fun on twisty roads. When cruising around town, the racy styling will turn heads.                    ,"

While the XTS is competent, not even the Vsport is much fun to drive.

A manual is not offered, but you won’t care when this brute hits 60 mph in 3.6 seconds and 100 mph just 3.9 seconds later. The steering is accurate yet hefty, while the ride is surprisingly civilized thanks to a magnetorheological suspension. Cadillac claims a top speed of 200 mph and we won’t argue.

The 109-hp motor, lithium-ion battery, and regenerative braking yielded 91 miles of range and 91 MPGe in our testing. Charging time on a 240-volt system is less than 5 hours. Upscale features such as heated and cooled leather front seats are optional. Currently the Soul EV is sold in a total of ten states, so check availability.                    ,"

The K900 is a muscular four-door stuffed with leather, wood trim, and electronic amusements all as standard. The base engine is a 311-hp V-6, while a 420-hp V-8 is optional. The steering is numb and the suspension is soft. Kia wants buyers to think the K900 is a value compared with its more-expensive competitors, but we’d rather spend less for a car that is more about driving than gadgets.                    ,"
Kia Soul,Kia,"$16,750",23/31,8.5,164,116,"Perhaps overshadowed by its eye-catching exterior, the Soul’s solid build quality and smart interior are the real deal. Base models get a 130-hp 1.6-liter four-cylinder with a slick six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic while uplevel models receive a 164-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and the automatic. With either engine, acceleration is relaxed at best. Despite the numb steering feel, the Soul is unexpectedly agile thanks to nicely controlled body roll and a refined suspension.                    ,"

The interior is roomy, with an elevated seating position for easy entry/exit and a clear view of the road ahead. A gas engine pairs with an electric motor for an output of 146 hp; estimated fuel economy is 50 mpg combined. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

Kia Sedona,Kia,"$27,695",17/22,7.4,276,122,"Snazzy, sporty, and striking aren’t words you associate with minivans—but the ambitious folks at Kia have managed to bake a little of each into the Sedona. With room for eight, storage for family necessities, and a long list of standard and optional safety features, the Sedona is a compelling choice for value-minded shoppers. Powered by a 276-hp V-6 with a six-speed transmission and boasting a smooth ride, the Sedona also injects a little fun into daily kid-ferrying duties.                    ,"
Kia Rio,Kia,"$16,345",,,,,"The Rio is a perky, well-equipped and fuel-efficient sedan or five-door hatchback—and as a Kia, it’s a great value. The 1.6-liter four-cylinder makes 138 hp and drives the front wheels through either a six-speed manual or slow-shifting six-speed automatic. The base LX has manual door locks and windows, A/C, and satellite radio. The EX gets power windows, cruise, and remote keyless entry.

A perky 134-hp 1.5-liter turbo three-cylinder strikes a balance between fun and frugality with either the standard six-speed manual or optional paddle-shifted six-speed automatic. The Cooper Hardtop is a highly customizable, distinctively styled and zippy three-door runabout; a five-door hatchback model provides an extra level of practicality.                    ,"
Mini Cooper Hardtop S / JCW,Mini,"$25,250",23/31,6.0,228,N/A,"Quirky styling and nimble handling help the Cooper S to inject a dose of excitement into your daily commute. A 189-hp 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic provides enough scoot to live up to the car’s sporting intentions. A five-door model is now offered so that the Cooper S can (almost) make a case for itself as a family car; a JCW version of the three-door boasts a brawnier 228-hp 2.0-liter four, a tuned suspension, and a host of racy styling tweaks.                    ,"
Kia Forte Koup,Kia,"$20,740",22/29,6.9,201,142,"The Forte coupe—or Koup, in Kia-speak—is sportier and more elegant than other Fortes; it’s also well equipped and surprisingly refined.

A six-speed manual is standard, with a six-speed automatic optional on both. Steering and handling are nicely balanced. Alas, the Koup is no screamer, but it is sporty enough to satisfy all but the most hard-core enthusiasts.                    ,"
Kia Forte,Kia,"$17,340",29/38,8.7,147,122,"More than just a budget box, the Forte offers lots of features at a pocket-pleasing price.

The hot-hatch Forte5 has a 2.0-liter four and a six-speed automatic or manual. A 1.6-liter turbo with a seven-speed dual-clutch is optional.

Mini Cooper Paceman S / JCW,Mini,"$27,750",23/30,7.3,181,129,"Fewer doors equals less practicality: With two doors and a hatch, the Paceman is the downsized version of the Countryman. The S has a 181-hp, 1.6-liter turbo engine that teams up with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission; all-wheel drive is optional. The JCW makes 208 hp and has standard all-wheel drive, a retuned suspension, 18-inch wheels, and an aero kit. These maxi-Minis are full of Mini DNA, but the extra weight slows them down.

Kia hasn’t made performance a priority, but it’s still sufficient, and the upscale interior makes it very comfortable.

Mini Cooper Clubman S / JCW,Mini,"$28,500",24/34,6.6,189,140,"Sports-car athleticism and cheeky styling are hallmarks of the Mini brand; cargo space isn’t, so here’s the Clubman S with up to 48 cubic feet of storage.

The S and John Cooper Works versions offer more power and all-wheel-drive options. The Countryman retains the quintessential Mini driving characteristics and quirkiness of the brand, despite its larger dimensions.                    ,"

Mini Cooper Clubman,Mini,"$24,950",25/34,8.0,134,127,"More like the “maxi” from Mini, the Clubman still offers sporty handling and peppy performance. Under the hood is a 134-hp 1.5-liter turbo three-cylinder with a six-speed manual and front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional, as is a six-speed automatic. An upscale interior boasts snazzy ambient lighting; leather seats cost extra. With up to 48 cu ft of cargo room, the Clubman offers utility in a unique package. In our experience, though, reliability is a weak point for the Mini brand.                    ,"
Mini Cooper Convertible S / JCW,Mini,"$30,450",23/33,6.2,189,143,"Those seeking to dial up the fun in a Mini convertible can opt for the more powerful S or JCW.

A six-speed manual is standard on both; a paddle-shifted six-speed automatic is optional. A blast to drive on smooth roads, ride quality suffers on bumpy surfaces.                    ,"
Mini Cooper Convertible,Mini,"$26,800",27/37,7.5,134,124,"Sun worshippers and Mini mavens continue to find this convertible irresistible—and can you blame them? Its attractions include a power top that folds flat in 18 seconds, an “Openometer” gauge that keeps track of how long you’ve motored with the top down, the joy of unlimited headroom, and plenty of charisma. Otherwise, it’s just like driving the previous-generation Mini hardtop with the base four-cylinder engine. Downsides include leisurely performance, a tiny trunk, and annoying cowl shake.                    ,"

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are optional on the ES and standard on the SE. The powertrain has a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty; the corrosion warranty is 7 years/100,000 miles; and roadside assist is 5 years/unlimited miles.                    ,"

Nissan Juke,Nissan,"$21,190",26/31,6.9,188,124,"The Juke puts the “fun” in “funky,” making it perfect for those who want a spry and speedy little runabout that also stands out in traffic. It’s powered by a 188-hp 1.6-liter turbo four-cylinder with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional. Sadly, a CVT is the only available transmission, which takes some joy out of driving. On the plus side, its light and informative steering makes it easy to fling around back-country curves or to jockey for position on a crowded interstate.                    ,"
Nissan Juke NISMO / NISMO RS,Nissan,"$25,770",25/31,6.7,215,135,"If you’re looking to turn up the insanity on the standard and already-cheeky Juke, there’s the NISMO and NISMO RS. The NISMO comes with a 188-hp 1.6-liter turbo four-cylinder, ground effects, a lowered suspension, and sport seats. Need more? Step up to the 215-hp (211 with AWD) NISMO RS with additional chassis mods and a unique fascia. Both offer a six-speed-manual and front-wheel drive; torque-vectoring all-wheel drive is offered, but only with a mundane continuously variable transmission.                    ,"
Nissan Leaf,Nissan,"$29,875",124/101,10.4,107,93,"The Leaf’s earth-friendly image, relaxed ride, and spacious cabin make it an affordable EV with everyday usability. SL and SV trims get a 30-kWh battery that offers an EPA-rated 107-mile range; base S models make do with a 24-kWh battery and an 84-mile range. The electric motor has great low-end power for around-town driving; in our testing we averaged 114 MPGe. Although its supple ride and quiet interior make it easy to live with, its design and technology are beginning to show the Leaf’s age.                    ,"
Nissan NV1500 / 2500 / 3500,Nissan,"$27,935",,,,,"Although it looks like the offspring of a Titan pickup and an armored car, there’s a lot to like about this unorthodox van. Choices of regular and high-roof models, three payload configurations, and a standard 261-hp V-6 or optional 317-hp V-8 are designed to meet the needs of business users. The NV3500 HD passenger version offers seating for 12, tinted side windows, curtain airbags, and a navigation system, making it an attractive proposition for livery service, sports teams, or big families.                    ,"
Nissan Maxima,Nissan,"$33,395",22/30,5.9,300,135,"It’s time to stop pressuring the Maxima to live up to its billing as a four-door sports car and accept it for what it is: a bargain-priced luxury car. A gutsy 3.5-liter V-6 makes 300 hp and drives the front wheels through a CVT. The cabin is quiet, has an 8.0-inch touchscreen with navigation and Apple CarPlay, and can be fitted with diamond-quilted seat inserts, mahogany wood trim, and ambient lighting. Adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking are standard on all but the base S.                    ,"
Nissan GT-R,Nissan,"$111,685",16/23,2.9,600,191,"Doesn’t matter what you call it—GT-R or, more fittingly, Godzilla—Nissan’s range topper is a supercar-stomping, high-tech dynamo. Its 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 makes a mighty 565 hp while a six-speed dual-clutch automatic and all-wheel drive team up to put all that power to the pavement. The GT-R’s quick steering, rigid structure and adjustable suspension can make even amateurs feel positively heroic from behind the wheel. Want more? Check out the track-ready NISMO-tuned variant with 600 hp.                    ,"
Dodge Viper,Dodge,"$90,390",12/21,3.4,645,N/A,"The Viper is both all-American and a true exotic, with lots of curves and bulges in all the right places to let you know it means business. The long nose, bodacious body, and predatory stare give the Viper a menacing look, while its 645-hp, 8.4-liter V-10 can catapult it to 60 mph in about three seconds. For the ultimate track monster, check out the Viper ACR. With all kinds of aero aids, special tires by Kumho and carbon-ceramic brakes, Dodge says it is the fastest Viper on a racetrack.                    ,"
Nissan Altima,Nissan,"$23,365",27/39,8.2,182,121,"Curvy, dramatic styling mimics bigger brother Maxima and gives the Altima an upscale vibe. Engine choices are either a 182-hp 2.5-liter four or a 270-hp 3.5-liter V-6, both with a CVT. The SR infuses a little fun by adding stiffer suspension tuning, paddle shifters, and unique wheels. Forward emergency braking with adaptive cruise control creates a robust active-safety bundle. Overall, the Altima is a capable sedan with a decent options list and a roomy, comfortable cabin.                    ,"
Dodge Journey,Dodge,"$22,240",16/24,7.8,283,118,"Practicality is the name of the game when creating a tolerable family transporter, and the Journey has it in spades—excitement, however, is another story. Buyers get a choice between a 173-hp 2.4-liter four or a 283-hp 3.6-liter V-6 as well as front- or all-wheel drive. Its attractive and comfortable interior offers plenty of storage and can be outfitted with seats for five or seven. The base Journey’s ride is composed, but the sportier R/T’s is too stiff for all but the smoothest roads.                    ,"
Nissan Armada,Nissan,"$45,495",13/18,5.9,390,133,"As Nissan’s double-duty SUV, the Armada can tow up to 8500 pounds and has space for eight. Sold in Infiniti showrooms as the QX80, the Armada inherits its luxury-branded counterpart’s plush interior and comes standard with navigation, Bose audio, and an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking are optional on SL models and standard on the Platinum. A 390-hp 5.6-liter V-8 drives the rear or all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic.                    ,"
Nissan Frontier,Nissan,"$19,230",15/20,7.6,265,108,"The old stone that is the Frontier keeps rolling—its basic design dates to 2005, it’s had only minimal changes since 2009, and a replacement probably won’t arrive for a few more years. To meet the needs of buyers today, the Frontier offers extended-cab or crew-cab versions, with a base 152-hp 2.5-liter four or optional 261-hp 4.0-liter V-6, a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic, rear-wheel or all-wheel-drive versions, and trim levels ranging from base to the Baja-inspired Desert Runner.                    ,"
Dodge Grand Caravan,Dodge,"$26,090",17/25,7.9,283,113,"If a no-nonsense family hauler is what you’re after, there are few options better than the Grand Caravan. It skips most of the luxuries of the just-launched Chrysler Pacifica, with which it shares a showroom, in favor of a simpler, budget-minded approach. A 283-hp 3.6-liter V-6 powers the front wheels through a six-speed automatic. The roomy cabin seats seven and has Chrysler’s clever Stow ’n Go folding second row of seats; well-weighted steering inspires confidence and even adds a little fun.                    ,"
Dodge Challenger,Dodge,"$33,985",15/23,5.1,375,155,"The Challenger is one big bruiser, with heft better suited to cruising or drag-racing at the strip than turning laps on a race track. Powertrains include the standard 305-hp 3.6-liter V-6 and an eight-speed auto; a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 makes 375 hp when paired with the standard six-speed manual and 372 hp with the optional eight-speed automatic. The Scat Pack option features a 485-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V-8; a six-speed manual is standard and a eight-speed auto is optional.                    ,"
Dodge Durango,Dodge,"$31,090",14/22,6.2,360,120,"The Durango remains big, brawny, and masculine in an era of soft, curvaceous crossovers, but it’s not as trucklike as other large SUVs. Powertrains include a 295-hp 3.6-liter V-6 or a 360-hp 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, both offered in rear- or all-wheel-drive guises; an eight-speed automatic is standard. The V-6 models are enough for most, while Hemi models deliver excellent torque, especially handy for towing. Uconnect infotainment with an 8.4-inch touchscreen and satellite radio is optional.                    ,"
Dodge Charger SRT / SRT Hellcat,Dodge,"$52,240",13/22,3.4,707,N/A,"SRT is Mopar-speak for “Give it a really big engine,” and the Charger SRT and SRT Hellcat got the memo. The Charger SRT boasts a 485-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 and an adaptive suspension with auto, sport, and track modes. The engine is awesome, but the ride quality is harsh in any of the three settings and the steering lacks feedback. Topping the horsepower charts is the SRT Hellcat, which makes an amazing 707 hp from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8; it’s the most powerful production sedan on earth.                    ,"
Dodge Charger,Dodge,"$29,090",19/31,6.2,300,140,"A muscle car for the family, the Charger offers the style and stance to intimidate more mainstream sedans. The sport-tuned suspension and accurate steering lend a decidedly agile feel for such a big car, without compromising a compliant ride. A 292-hp 3.6-liter V-6 (300 hp with a Rallye appearance package), an eight-speed automatic, and rear-wheel drive are standard; all-wheel drive is optional. Two brawnier rear-drive Hemi V-8s are also available—a 370-hp 5.7-liter or a 485-hp 6.4-liter.                    ,"
Dodge Challenger SRT / SRT Hellcat,Dodge,"$50,290",13/22,3.6,707,199,"The Challenger is a major salvo in the Horsepower Wars, offering muscle-car metal and seriously awesome engines. The 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 makes 485 hp and 475 lb-ft; choose either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic. The aptly named Hellcat has a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 good for 707 hp and 650 lb-ft, with either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic. The automatic is faster, hitting 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, while the manual is more fun and still quick doing 0–60 in 3.9 seconds.                    ,"
Dodge Dart,Dodge,"$18,090",23/35,8.2,184,127,"While the Dart is uniquely styled, it is otherwise a rather disappointing offering. A 160-hp 2.0-liter four, six-speed manual, and front-wheel drive are standard; a 160-hp 1.4-liter turbo four and 184-hp 2.4-liter four are optional. Six-speed automatics are offered on the 2.0- and 2.4-liter engines. An available 8.4-inch touchscreen is easy to use, and several appearance packages provide considerable personalization. The Dart will soon drop from the lineup, so watch for closeout deals.                    ,"

The Supercharged model’s V-8 is fortified to 510 hp, fed to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a four-wheel-drive system that features more adjustments than a chiropractor. If the standard-wheelbase model isn’t enough, a long-wheelbase version with an added 7.3 inches of rear legroom is available.                    ,"

Land Rover Range Rover Evoque,Land Rover,"$42,795",20/28,8.1,240,130,"The Evoque is nothing if not a head-turner, but its visual drama compromises practicality. The styling comes at a cost to both cargo space and outward visibility; three- and five-foor body styles are offered. Also, curiously enough, so is a convertible. A 240-hp turbo four with a nine-speed automatic and a firm suspension give it the moves to match its sporting character, but the ride is often harsh and raucous. The lavish interior impresses, with high-quality materials and luxury features.                    ,"
Land Rover Range Rover Sport Supercharged / SVR,Land Rover,"$81,645",14/19,4.3,550,144,"Very few vehicles can venture off-road, tackle the Nürburgring, and haul five passengers in luxurious comfort, but the Range Rover Sport Supercharged is one of them. A 510-hp supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, eight-speed automatic, and adjustable four-wheel-drive system help it easily hustle down any road or trail. The SVR model ups horsepower to 550 and features a stiffer suspension for even better handling, while a leather-lined and feature-packed interior help it earn its Range Rover badging.                    ,"
Land Rover Range Rover Sport,Land Rover,"$66,645",22/29,7.6,254,134,"Agility isn’t normally a word that springs to mind when the subject is a 2.5-ton luxury SUV—but the Range Rover Sport blends a certain enthusiasm with legendary off-road prowess. Engine choices are a 340-hp 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 or a remarkably quiet, efficient 254-hp 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6. Both are matched to an eight-speed automatic and four-wheel drive. Classic styling, smart features, sharp handling, and go-anywhere reputation make the Range Rover Sport a well-rounded package.                    ,"
Land Rover LR4,Land Rover,"$51,395",15/19,6.7,340,123,"The safari-ready LR4 is the automotive equivalent of Bear Grylls, albeit with James Bond’s wardrobe. Powered by a 340-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and driving all four wheels, the LR4 is equally at home on the trails or touring the suburban wilderness. An array of off-road gadgetry is offered, including hill descent control, an adjustable air suspension, and a Terrain Response system. Seating for seven and a luxury-lined interior is icing on the cake.                    ,"
Land Rover Discovery Sport,Land Rover,"$38,690",,,,,"The dapper looks of the Discovery Sport conceal its serious off-road credentials, which set it apart from its more on-road-oriented rivals. A 240-hp 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder, a nine-speed automatic, and standard all-wheel drive promise efficient all-weather performance. A four-mode Terrain Response system helps it adapt to a variety of situations—sand, snow, rocks, or mud. Seating for seven in a luxury-lined cabin means the whole family can tag along in comfort on adventures big or small.                    ,"
Land Rover Range Rover,Land Rover,"$86,645",22/29,7.3,254,N/A,"The Range Rover caters to every conceivable need by offering luxury and off-road prowess. The 340-hp supercharged V-6—with an eight-speed automatic and four-wheel drive—offers a decent compromise between power and efficiency. There is also a 254-hp turbodiesel V-6 with 440 lb-ft of torque. Standard and long wheelbase models are equally posh, especially in Autobiography trim, and feature lots of tech.

Somewhat obscure, and very low production, it’s a hard-core machine for discriminating connoisseurs with sufficient liquidity.

The lusty 6.3-liter V-12 makes 680 hp at an eardrum-tickling 8000 rpm. That power routes through a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic; Ferrari claims a 0-60 time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 208 mph. The interior boasts acres of leather and a 10.3-inch infotainment screen with capacitive-touch controls.

While the coupe is no longer sold, rumors hint at a topless Spider model. Expect it to have the same 789-hp V-12 as its hardtop predecessor, with a 161-hp boost from an electric motor. That’s right, it’s a hybrid—enabling it to accelerate like a Bugatti Chiron while achieving somewhat respectable fuel economy. Far prettier than its predecessor, the Enzo, the LaFerrari is styled like a ground-bound fighter jet.                    ,"
Ferrari F12berlinetta,Ferrari,"$323,745",,,,,"Sure, it costs more than a house, but the metal-melting aria from that incredibly operatic engine—priceless.

Even with all that power, the F12berlinetta is one of Ferrari’s more comfortable cars, making it a true daily-driver.

It’s the softest in the Ferrari range, designed for daily ease and use—it even has a cupholder. Powered by a 552-hp 3.9-liter V-8 mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch auto, the T is plenty quick and agile, though not as rewarding as a 488.

A dual-clutch seven-speed is the sole transmission; we estimate a 0–60 time of 3.0 seconds. Ferrari’s revised adaptive suspension provides a relatively compliant ride without sacrificing handling. For those who really want to hear that V-8 sing, the Spider offers a retractable hardtop that raises or lowers at speeds up to 25 mph.                    ,"
